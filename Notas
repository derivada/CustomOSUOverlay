2. RECONNECTING WEB SOCKET

reconnecting-websocket.js es para el socket
" A small decorator for the JavaScript WebSocket API that automatically reconnects "
With a ReconnectingWebSocket, after an onclose event is called it will automatically attempt to reconnect. 
In addition, a connection is attempted repeatedly (with a small pause) until it succeeds.
So the events you receive may look something more like:
onopen
onmessage
onmessage
onmessage
onclose
// ReconnectingWebSocket attempts to reconnect
onopen
onmessage
onmessage
onmessage
onclose
// ReconnectingWebSocket attempts to reconnect
onopen
onmessage
onmessage
onmessage
onclose

var socket = new ReconnectingWebSocket(url, protocols, options);
